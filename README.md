# Web-to-Arduino
Small project. Neopixels are connected on a breadboard to a arduino. The arduino is controlled from the computer, and the computers signals are controlled by a simple webinterface. This project can super easily be added to work remote, so you could controle the lights from the webinterface without the pc connected to the arduino.

The system already has some basic features and animations - Theese can be seen on the bottom link under the screenshots selection
